# SpotifyController
React.js + Django application that makes use of Spotify API to control the state of a user Spotify listening session. A user will login and authenticate their Spotify account. The user then has the opportunity to create a room or join using a unique room code that is generated by the backend.
If a user creates a room they will set commands and permissions, like votes to skip and if guests can pause music.

The Spotify API connnects with custom serializers to constatnly refresh the status of music being played and display it on the frontend.
